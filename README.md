# Portfolio Site


Welcome to my porfolio site! After going through the immersive Front End Engineering program at (The Iron Yard Cincinnati) [https://www.theironyard.com/cincinnati] I created this site to showcase my skills as a front end developer and to highlight some of the projects that I worked on while in the program.  Technologies used include [Javascript] (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), [CSS] (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS), [HTML] (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) and [jQuery] (https://jquery.com/).  The site is hosted on [GitHub Pages] (https://pages.github.com/).
